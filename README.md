MINI PROJECT ON CONDUCT A PERSONAL CYBER HYGIENE AUDIT

A personal cyber hygiene audit is a self-assessment process to evaluate your digital security practices and identify areas for improvement in protecting your devices, data, and online activities from cyber threats. Its fundamental objective is to shield user accounts, data, and systems from potential attacks that may jeopardize their security. By adhering to cyber hygiene principles, individuals and organizations can fortify their defenses and minimize the risks associated with online vulnerabilities. 
Areas of Audit are as follows:

Passwords and Authentication:
a. Are your passwords strong, unique, and regularly updated?
Answer: Yes, they are strong and unique but not regularly updated.
b. Do you use a password manager or enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)?
Yes, I enable multi-factor authentication.

Device Security:
a. Are your devices protected by updated antivirus software and firewalls?
Answer: No
b. Do you keep your operating system, smartphone, and software/ applications up to date? Yes.

Social Media Privacy:
a. Are your social media profiles configured for maximum privacy?
Answer: Yes
b. Are you currently oversharing personal information, and do you regularly review privacy settings? No, I don’t overshare personal information but review privacy settings.

Email Practices:
a. Do you recognize and avoid phishing attempts?
Answer: Yes.
b. How do you verify email sources, and what do you do when you see suspicious links?
Answer: I verify email source by checking the sender's email address, looking for red flags in the email content, verify the email header, checking for domain authentication and when I see suspicious link, I don’t click on suspicious links or attachments but delete the link(s).

Data Backup:
a. Do you regularly back up important data to secure locations?
Answer: Not really.
b. Do you encrypt your data?
Answer: Yes.

Risk Analysis:
Password not regularly updated can lead increased risks of unauthorized access to my accounts, including potential identity theft, data breaches, and financial loss.

Failing to update antivirus software and firewalls leaves my devices vulnerable to a range of cyber threats, including malware infections, data breaches, and system crashes, potentially leading to financial loss, reputational damage, and legal issues.

Failing to back up data can lead to serious consequences, including permanent data loss due to accidents, human error, cyberattacks, hardware failures, or natural disasters, potentially impacting productivity, financial stability, and even business closure.
Action Plan: I will implement Regular changing of my password to limits the exposure to long-term compromise. It’s important that I regularly have the latest updates of antivirus software installed on my devices and carryout periodic scanning. To "remedy" data loss or corruption, a proactive approach involving regular data backups is crucial. Consider options like cloud storage, external hard drives, or specialized backup software to create copies of your data, ensuring its safety and accessibility in case of unforeseen circumstances. I will then regularly monitor my cybersecurity practices and update them as needed. And stay informed about the latest cybersecurity threats and trends to proactively protect yourself from potential risks.
